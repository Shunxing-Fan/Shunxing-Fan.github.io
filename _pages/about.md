My full name is Shunxing Fan, pronounced like "Soon-Sing Fan" in English, or you can just call me "Fan". I am a master student in Machine Learning at [Mohamed bin Zayed University of Artificial Intelligence (MBZUAI)](https://mbzuai.ac.ae/){:target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"}, supervised by [Prof. Kun Zhang](https://www.andrew.cmu.edu/user/kunz1/){:target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"}. Before that, I received my bachelor's degree in Statistics from [Huazhong University of Science and Technology (HUST)](https://english.hust.edu.cn/){:target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"}.

## Research Interests
I have broad interests in machine learning and AI for healthcare. My current research direction is causal discovery and causal representation learning.
